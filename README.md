## Homework DUE in your repo by Tuesday Feb 21 BEFORE class at 11am.

1. Fork this project to your repository.
2. Clone **your fork** to your computer.
3. Complete the development tasks listed below then commit and push your changes back up to your GitHub repo.

## Development Tasks: Using Python unittest module.
The babyset project contains a src directory that contains the definition for class named *BabySet* (baby_set.py) and a file containing unit tests that utilize module ```pytest``` for the BabySet class methods (test_babyset.py).

### Step 1:
```test_baby_set.py``` requires that you implement the unit tests for for the four test cases marked as **pass**. Read ```baby_set.py``` to understand what you need to test and use the existing unit test implementations as a guide.

**Run the tests.**

### Step 2:
The ```baby_set.py``` contains ONE logic error that will cause your unit tests to fail. Fix those errors so that all tests **pass**.

### Step 3. 
Commit your changes and push to your remote repository.
